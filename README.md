Portfolio project on optimising a model for real-life data

# Water Quality: Drinking water potability


## EXPLANATION 

The project uses a water quality dataset from Kaggle. It uses a number of measurements to predict whether or not the water is drinkable by humans.

## DATA
The dataset that I used was uploaded to Kaggle by a user named Aditya Kadiwal 

## MODEL 
The model used in this project is a Support Vector Machine. It was chosen because it gave marginally better performance than other machine learning models.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
Description of which hyperparameters you have and how you chose to optimise them. 
Although the default hyperparameters gave slightly superior performance, I also carried out hyperparameter optimisation using Grid Search and Bayesian Optimisation as a comparison.
Hyperparameters that were chosen for optimisation were the kernel type, the regularization parameter (C) and the kernel coefficient for the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel (gamma).



## RESULTS
A summary of your results and what you can learn from your model 

The model's performance is as follows:

Accuracy: 0.6581892166836215
Recall: 0.255
Precision: 0.7285714285714285

I have learned a model is only as good as the data that is used to train and tune it. Poor quality data and data from dubious sources will impact the model's performance and usefulness in te real world.
